  - That sticky annotations and pages with "position: absolute" style are messed up after combined.
  - That non-link style sheets cause the combiner to freeze.
  - That some files linked by a page get lost after combined.

----------------

Bug fixes:
- Fixed an issue that frame pages are messed up after capture and that some of them are not captured.

- Fixed an issue that re-capture prompts multiples dialogs.

Improve the editor:
- Delete and DOMEraser can now delete all ScrapBook additions, including highlights, inline annotation, sticky annotations, attached links, etc.
- Removing a highlight no longer leaves an empty span tag.
- No longer creates an empty span at the end of the previous paragraph or at the start of the next paragraph it no contents are in them.

Improve the undo function:
- Now all ScrapBook edit actions are undo-able and no longer asks for saving. (Note: linking to another page or moving a tab to another window still purges the action history)
- Undos are now infinite, instead of only once.
- Correctly separates the undo action across different tabs.

Improve file name support:
- Non-ASCII chars in the file name can now be preserved. Long file names are truncated to prevent potential issues.

Support subfolders:
- Allow subfolders in under each data entry (directory). Correctly calculates size of files in subfolders and no errors on deleting a data with subfolder in it. (ScrapBook doesn't create subfolders on capturing data, but you can add them manually, to embed web data from other sources)

Others:
- No longer opens the item clicked if Shift or Ctrl key is down for multiple selection.
- All highlights and annotations are added "data-sb-obj" attribute for better scripting or automation.
