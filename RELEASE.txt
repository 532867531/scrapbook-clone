Scrapbook X 1.7.0
----------------

Basic:
- Move preference settings to "extensions.scrapbook" from "scrapbook" to fit Firefox standard policy.
- Updated some basic info of this addon.
- Integrated Arabic, Hungarian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Ukrainian localization.

Major Features:
- Redefined capture options:
  - "Images": if not checked, the resources linked by <img>, <embed>, <source>, etc, are linked to the original source instead of being removed.
  - "Styles": if not checked, global external (linked) styles and internal (style) styles are removed. Inline styles of elements are preserved from now on.
  - "JavaScript": if not checked, all javascript triggering attributes such as "onclick", "onkeydown", etc, in the page are removed.
- Minimized the source code reprocessing on capturing, saving, or combinding a page.
- Improved the support of HTML5 standard.
- No more record the current form status on capturing for privacy concerns.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed error processing of "background", "bgcolor", "text", etc, attributes for <body>, <table>, etc, elements on page capture.
- Fixed error CSS processing, particularly those with "content:" value and URL with data URI scheme.
- Fixed an issue that some CSS settings may become whole body wide after page combine.
- Linked files to be download no more be added to the list in deep capture mode.


Scrapbook X 1.6.3
----------------

- Fixed an issue capturing a local file gets a bad title.
- Fixed an issue that the dialog does not close at the end of a multiple-capture process.
- Fixed an issue that the "All Links in the Selection" URL detector in "Save Multiple URLs" doesn't work.
- Fixed issues about the combiner:
  - That the combiner may combine pages incorrectly and results in only one page.
  - That sticky annotations and pages with "position: absolute" style are messed up after combined.
  - That non-link style sheets cause the combiner to freeze.
  - That some files linked by a page get lost after combined.


Scrapbook X 1.6.2
----------------

- Adjusts handling of sticky annotations. They are now draggable only in the edit mode, have undo history saved only once at the pre-edit, and are automatically saved on page saving.
- Updatea a component interface for better compatibility.



ScrapBook X 1.6.1
----------------

Bug fixes:
- Fixed an issue that frame pages are messed up after capture and that some of them are not captured.
- Fixed an issue that deep capture process frequently freezes.
- Fixed an issue that re-capture prompts multiples dialogs.

Improve the editor:
- Delete and DOMEraser can now delete all ScrapBook additions, including highlights, inline annotation, sticky annotations, attached links, etc.
- Removing a highlight no longer leaves an empty span tag.
- No longer creates an empty span at the end of the previous paragraph or at the start of the next paragraph it no contents are in them.

Improve the undo function:
- Now all ScrapBook edit actions are undo-able and no longer asks for saving. (Note: linking to another page or moving a tab to another window still purges the action history)
- Undos are now infinite, instead of only once.
- Correctly separates the undo action across different tabs.

Improve file name support:
- Non-ASCII chars in the file name can now be preserved. Long file names are truncated to prevent potential issues.

Support subfolders:
- Allow subfolders in under each data entry (directory). Correctly calculates size of files in subfolders and no errors on deleting a data with subfolder in it. (ScrapBook doesn't create subfolders on capturing data, but you can add them manually, to embed web data from other sources)

Others:
- No longer opens the item clicked if Shift or Ctrl key is down for multiple selection.
- All highlights and annotations are added "data-sb-obj" attribute for better scripting or automation.
