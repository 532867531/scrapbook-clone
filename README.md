Generally we follow the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model in developing. We have "master" as the main branch, "devel" as the developing branch, "release-*" and "hotfix-*" as supportive branches, and added a "test-*" for temporary testing purpose, which could be changed or removed in the future. Other branches are feature branches.
