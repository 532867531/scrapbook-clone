Scrapbook X 1.13.0b15
=====================

Changes since v1.13.0b14
------------------------

Bug fixes:

 * A filename in a URL mixed with percent encoded components and
   standalone "%"s is not saved decoded.

 * A CSS-linked file with a filename containing "'" may be not captured.

 * For a deep capture, the capture complete notification shows up and the
   bold marking of the item disappears as early as the main page has just
   been captured (these should happen when all pages have been captured
   instead).

 * The icon of the capture complete notification for Capture Again is
   blanked.

 * The icon of the capture complete notification for a capture of an image
   or a file is blanked.

 * CSS in an XHTML page is not processed when capturing.

 * A page linked from an XHTML page and has a path containing certain
   special characters (such as "!", "'", or "~") causes some interlinks be
   not built.

 * Certain styles and scripts become broken when an XHTML page is captured
   as HTML via "Capture presenting HTML for non-HTML files".

 * Some editor functions, such as DOM Erasor and Freenote, does not work
   for an XHTML page.

 * The interactive function of the web page generated by Output HTML
   doesn't work if not all items are selected for output.

Functionality changes:

 * Spaces in a URL now are saved encoded.

   Some attributes, such as srcset, require the URL containing no space,
   or they cannot work correctly.

 * The filename of a deep captured webpage is now saved minimal encoded
   like an embeded file is.

 * The combine wizard now supports HTML5 tags and attributes.

User interface changes:

 * "Skip" in Capture dialog can now be invoked during the countdown time.

Also includes a little internal code optimization.
