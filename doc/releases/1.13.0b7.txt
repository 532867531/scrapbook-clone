Scrapbook X 1.13.0b7
====================

Changes since v1.13.0b6
-----------------------

Bug fixes:

 * The data link of an "object" element is not rewritten correctly on capture.

 * A "source" element under a "picture" element is not handled correctly on capture.

 * A script error occurs when internalizing a page with an "img" or "source" element having "srcset" attribute.

Functionality changes:

 * Non-captured media now writes a non-functional URI containing the source rather then "about:blank".

 * Adjusted the user interface behavior of the data tree:

   * Ctrl/Shift+Enter no more opens a folder-type folder.

   * Ctrl/Shift+Space no more opens the item in the manage window.

   * Mid-click no more works in the folder picker window.

Core changes:

 * Switch strftime to a new library.

Also includes some internal code optimization and documentation improving.
