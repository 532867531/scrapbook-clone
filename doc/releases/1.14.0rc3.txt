Scrapbook X 1.14.0rc3
=====================

Changes since v1.14.0rc2
------------------------

 * User interface improvements:

   * "Open Source URL" commands are now disabled if the current item has
      no source URL recorded.

   * Fixed an issue that "Open Source URL" in the toolbar dropdown menu
     doesn't work for non-HTMl files.

   * "Open Source URL" in the toolbar dropdown menu now loads the page
     with the current hash.

   * Recovered the "Site Map" command in the toolbar dropdown menu.

   * Recovered the old-style status bar button in Firefox < 4.0.
     (Available via Status-4-Evar or another similar add-on.)

 * Added and changed several user preferences:

   * Changed "fulltext.sitePagesLimit": now 0 means 0 ("index no deep
     page") and a negative means infinity ("index unlimited deep pages").

   * Added "fulltext.updateSizeThreshold": if the cache size is smaller
     than this set size (KiB), it is updated whenever a fulltext search
     is performed. (A negative means infinity, i.e. always update cache.)

   * Added "fulltext.updateTimeThreshold": if the cache file is older
     than this set time (minutes), it will be updated when a fulltext
     search is performed. (A negative means infinity, i.e. never update
     an old cache.)

   * Added "data.rdfBackupKeepDays": backup RDFs that are older than this
     set time (days) will be removed during a check. (A negative means
     infinity, i.e. never remove backup RDFs.)

   * Added "data.rdfBackupRemoveLimit": the maximal number of expired backup
     RDFs that will be removed during a check. (A negative means infinity,
     i.e. remove all expired backup RDFs during a check.)

 * When the "data.path" preference is manually modified, ScrapBook X
   now will keep using the old value, and no more automatically
   refreshes the UI and outputs HTML tree.

Also includes some code clean-up and documentation improvements.
