Scrapbook X 1.12.24
===================

Changes since v1.12.23
----------------------

- FIXED: Deep capture could fail when "script" option is checked.
- FIXED: Capture link fails when targeting an attachment file.
- FIXED: Capture detail options sometimes differ to previous used ones.
- FIXED: No more displays "false" for the HTTP status code in the deep capture dialog.
- FIXED: Adjusted text length restrictions, now are mostly based on UTF-8 bytes rather than UTF-16 chars. This also prevents capturing too long file name on Unix.
- UPDATE: Links with a hash targeting the current page now points to the captured fragment whenever possible.
