Scrapbook X 1.13.0b
===================

Changes since v1.12.32
----------------------

Bug fixes:

 * Downloaded media now use HTTP header defined filename if it exists.
   This also fixed several issues for embeded media if the rendering
   effect depends on their file extension.

 * HTML5 <video> and <audio> tags with "src" attribute are not captured
   correctly.

Functionality changes:

 * Non-detail captures now use previously used detail capture options.

   Note that "download linked files" and "in-depth capture" options are
   still available only via the detail dialog.

 * Capture detail options are now remembered via the user preference.

   This will make them more portable (via exporting preferences).

 * Added a capture detail option "Save data URI as file", which saves data
   URIs to local with a filename of its sha1 checksum.

   This allows the internalizer to save data URI images, which are mostly
   created from dragging local files into an editable note page, into
   normal embeded files.

 * No more duplicate the file when the capturer is about to save a local
   file to a target with exactly same filename and file content.
 
   A relative link in Firefox will become an absolute link when they are
   copied or cut to otherwhere, this feature used to create a chaos when
   editing note pages and moves embeded images.  With this change we can
   easily rewrite absolute links back to relative using the internalizer.

 * Reworked "Download linked files" functionality.
 
   Now uses regular expressions to filter the file extension, which is
   more flexible and portable.  Also added an option to use the file 
   extension defined in the HTTP header of each link, which could cause
   bad performance but would be useful in certain cases.

 * Adjusted the behavior of the capture dialog.
 
   Fixed some issues that "pause", "skip", and "abort" buttons didn't work
   as expected when clicked in some cases.  "Skip" button now never resumes
   a paused task, which allows the user to skip multiple items during the 
   pause.  "Abort" button now attempts to stop and finalize the current 
   capture when clicked once, and forces the capture task to shutdown when
   clicked for the second time.

Core changes:

 * Merged separated localization language pack files, and changed how
   sbCommonUtils.lang() works accordingly.

 * Added several core APIs.

 * Several structural code reworks, especially for the capture 
   functionality.

Documentation changes:

 * Release notes now goes one-file-for-one-version.
