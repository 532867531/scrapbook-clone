Scrapbook X 1.13.0b8
====================

Compatibility Notes
-------------------

 * Since this release we support customized hotkey combination. The recorded hotkey format is different to older ScrapBook versions, and as a result, if you switch from or back to the old version, you'd have to reset related hotkeys manually to get them work right.
