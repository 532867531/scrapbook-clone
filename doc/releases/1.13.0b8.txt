Scrapbook X 1.13.0b8
====================

Compatibility notes
-------------------

 * Since this release we support customized hotkey combination.
   The recorded hotkey format is different to older ScrapBook versions,
   and as a result, if you switch from or back to the old version,
   you'd have to reset related hotkeys manually to get them work right.
