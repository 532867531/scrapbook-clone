Scrapbook X 1.13.0b5
====================

Compatibility notes
-------------------

 * This release added a feature to convert a non-folder-type item into
   a folder to allow having subitems.  Older ScrapBook versions can read
   the same ScrapBook directory, but they would have problems on the user
   interface, or when searching, fulltext-indexing, importing, or
   exporting them.

   * User interface: Popup menus may not show correct directives.
     Mouse and keyboard behavior may be weird.

   * Searching: Non-folder-type folder items cannot be searched.

   * Fulltext-indexing: Non-folder-type folder items are not
     fulltext-indexed.

   * Importing: Non-folder-type folder items are imported as normal items.

   * Exporting: Non-folder-type folder items are exported as normal items.
     In even older versions they are not exportable.


Changes since v1.13.0b4
-----------------------

Bug fixes:

 * A capture process could be never completed if there are files that
   can't be downloaded.

 * Item icons in the ScrapBook icon folder are missing in the index page
   generated by "Output HTML tree".

 * Default item icons in the combined page no more use chrome: protocol,
   which is not cross-platform compatible.

 * Item icons are not exported, previewed, or imported correctly if it
   links to a file in the ScrapBook icon folder or in the data folder
   of another item.

 * Fixed a potential file reading error for Firefox < 4.0.

Functionality changes:

 * Files not captured successfully are now shown in a URI like
   "urn:scrapbook-download-error:http:..." instead of an invalid relative
   link.

 * Added "Convert to Folder" command to convert non-folder-type items
   (except for separators) into "folders".

   This would be useful if one wants to leave notes in the folder,
   to make a folder searchable, or to create a more natural tree
   structure to publish.  These can now be easily achieved by converting
   note pages into folders.

   If this feature is used, there could be some backward compatibility
   issues if the same data is opened in older ScrapBook versions.  See
   the compatibility notes above for detail.

 * Improved the user interface for "Download linked files" in the
   capture dialog.

   * Reset now don't apply immediately but changes only the value of
     the text area, which will be discarded if the dialog is cancled.

   * Use more clear default filters.

 * Improved the user interface for the data tree.

   * Prevents folder toggle for Ctrl- or Shift- click in the
     manager window.

   * Add space as the accesskey to open an item.

 * Improved the user interface for "Output HTML tree".

   * Added an arrow to indicate folder status.

   * Allows customized folder icons to be shown.

   * Added hover tooltip text for toggle buttons.

   * The animation for item action is now more clear.

   * Now use "treefolder.png" instead of "folder.png" as the default
     folder icon name, and no more generates "folder_open.png"
     accordingly.

Also includes internal code optimization, documentation improve, and
some typo fixes for previous release notes.
