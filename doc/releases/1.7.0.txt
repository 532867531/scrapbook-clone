Scrapbook X 1.7.0
=================

Changes since v1.6.3
--------------------

Basic:
- Move preference settings to "extensions.scrapbook" from "scrapbook" to fit Firefox standard policy.
- Updated some basic info of this addon.
- Integrated Arabic, Hungarian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Ukrainian localization.

Major Features:
- Redefined capture options:
  - "Images": if not checked, the resources linked by <img>, <embed>, <source>, etc, are linked to the original source instead of being removed.
  - "Styles": if not checked, global external (linked) styles and internal (style) styles are removed. Inline styles of elements are preserved from now on.
  - "JavaScript": if not checked, all javascript triggering attributes such as "onclick", "onkeydown", etc, in the page are removed.
- Minimized the source code reprocessing on capturing, saving, or combinding a page.
- Improved the support of HTML5 standard.
- No more record the current form status on capturing for privacy concerns.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed error processing of "background", "bgcolor", "text", etc, attributes for <body>, <table>, etc, elements on page capture.
- Fixed error CSS processing, particularly those with "content:" value and URL with data URI scheme.
- Fixed an issue that some CSS settings may become whole body wide after page combine.
- Linked files to be download no more be added to the list in deep capture mode.
