====================

Changes since v1.13.0b8
-----------------------

Bug fixes:

 * A capture process freezes up if there is an external image or font in the CSS and capture option is set to not capture it and not link it to source.

 * Capture again for a deep captured page may not work right if there is a page with a non-ASCII filename.

 * Fulltext index for a deep capture site may not work right if there is a page with a non-ASCII filename.

 * Unable to select the folder in the Multi-ScrapBook edit dialog.

Also include some internal code optimization.
