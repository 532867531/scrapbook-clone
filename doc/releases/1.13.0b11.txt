=====================

Changes since v1.13.0b10
------------------------

Bug fixes:

 * In certain situations a normal key is misintepreted as a hotkey and
   triggers an unexpected behavior.

User interface changes:

 * Added a context menu with "check/uncheck selected items" directives
   to the capture dialog.

 * Added "L" accesskey for the "locate" directive of the editor toolbar.

 * Moved import/export/reset preferences from the advanced option to
   the dropdown list of a new indivisual dialog button.

 * Added reset and delete buttons to the textboxes for hotkey
   customization.

 * No more clear the hotkey when only modifier keys are pressed in a
   textbox for hotkey customization.

 * Adjusted the hotkey description text for main menu button hotkey
   customization.

 * Added internal contrast to several icons so that they are more visible
   on a platform with a dark background theme.

Also includes some internal code optimization.
