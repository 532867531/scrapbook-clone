Scrapbook X 1.13.0rc1
=====================

Compatibility notes:

 * Notes are now plain-text only.

   A note saved in old versions with functional HTML markups will be
   load as plain-text since this version, and a note saved in this
   version may be load as HTML special chars encoded in the old
   versions.

 * Font size settings for notes now use pt instead of px unit.

   The underlying user preference recoding the font size is also
   changed.  Previous font size settings in an old version won't
   apply to new version and vice versa.


Changes since v1.13.0b15
------------------------

Bug fixes:

 * Middle click on the ScrapBook X toolbar button doesn't work.

Functionality changes:

 * The "crossorigin" attribute is no more removed when capturing.

 * Notes are now plain-text only.

   Previously a note saves raw HTML text as-is, and its content is
   sometimes shown as plain-text and sometimes as HTML, depending on
   the context.  This is highly inconsistent and confusing.  Since a
   note is more likely used for quick noting in the sidebar, and we
   already have Note Page as a full HTML-featured note, we decided
   to make notes strictly plain-text-only so that the user can
   easily paste-in any plain-text contents without worrying about
   breaking anything when they're read.

 * Font size settings for notes now use pt instead of px unit.

   Most softwares use pt for font size, and we made this change to
   make it more familiar to general users.

User interface changes:

 * Reorganized Capture Detail dialog.

   Page related information are now put in the "General" tab, and
   capture options are put in another "Options" tab.  The last used
   tab will be remembered.

 * Reorganized Options dialog.

   * Options in the Advanced tab are moved to the Organize tab.

   * Added a button to set the default capture options.

   * Adjusted the order of several options.

 * Allows hotkey customization for Manage window and Capture Multiple
   URLs.

 * The focus is now automatically set on the data tree when the
   ScrapBook X sidebar is toggled shown.

Also includes internal code optimization and documentation revise.
