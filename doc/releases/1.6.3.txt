=================

Changes since v1.6.2

- Fixed an issue that the dialog does not close at the end of a multiple-capture process.
- Fixed an issue that the "All Links in the Selection" URL detector in "Save Multiple URLs" doesn't work.

  - That some files linked by a page get lost after combined.
