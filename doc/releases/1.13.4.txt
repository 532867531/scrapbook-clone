Scrapbook X 1.13.4
==================

Changes since v1.13.3
---------------------

 * Fixed an issue that subsequent URLs different only in hash in the
   list of "Save Multiple URLs" causes the save process to freeze up.

 * Fixed an issue that the file counter and the URL in the loading
   message of the Save dialog is sometimes wrong.

 * URLs redirected to an already saved page are now marked as
   successfully saved rather than skipped.

 * Adjusted the highlight of the URLs being selected, being saved,
   and been skipped to make them more significant and to avoid a
   displaying issue on several platforms.

Also includes some documentation and localization improvements.
