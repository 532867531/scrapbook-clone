Scrapbook X 1.13.0b10
=====================

Changes since v1.13.0b9
-----------------------

Bug fixes:

 * Background images declared inside a media rule of an external CSS are not correctly captured.

 * The @import CSS rules and the media attribute of CSS link elements are not correctly handled by the combine wizard.

 * Several hotkeys for HTML editor and DOM erasor are overwritten by native Firefox hotkey and failed to work.

 * The "-" hotkey for DOM erasor fails to work.

 * Hotkey text are not shown in Mac style on Macs.

 * Added the missing "Manage Folder" icon to the context menu of a folder item.

 * Folders cannot be toggled in the HTML output page with frame in some browsers.

Functionality changes:

 * Allows customized hotkey combinations for HTML editor and DOM erasor.

   Hotkeys for HTML editor is available in the options dialog and user preference. Hotkeys for DOM erasor is only available in the user preference.

 * Move restart notify for hotkey customization to the top of the keys option panel.

 * Removed the "manage" button from the main sidebar.

   This button doesn't seem to be essential and already exists in the dropdown list of the "Tools".

 * Multi-ScrapBook is now always active.

   To reduce the complexity of managing ScrapBook directories, we now always activate the multi-ScrapBook mode and removed several unneeded options, user preferences, and internal codes.

   This also fixes some issues of the previous user interface. For example, when the user selects the default ScrapBook folder and then enters the multi-ScrapBook manager, the previously selected ScrapBook directory is no more "active" and undeletable.

   Also, if the user selects the default ScrapBook directory, the sidebar shows only "ScrapBook X" and the output HTML page shows only "ScrapBook" instead of having "Profile folder".

 * Incomplete ScrapBook directory paths are now treated as relative.

   This is to prevent a possible error for the multi-ScrapBook system. This change would also allow the user to set up ScrapBook directories relative to the Firefox profile directory by modifying the entries in the multiple.txt or the value of "data.path" user prefreence. Be aware that such usage is not downward compatible, breaks the GUI, could cause other issues and thus not recommended, though.

Also includes some internal code clean-up.
