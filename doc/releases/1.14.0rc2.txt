Scrapbook X 1.14.0rc2
=====================

Changes since v1.14.0rc1
------------------------

 * Fixed a regression that the search page of "Output HTML tree" does
   not load "custom.js" in the "tree" folder.

 * Improved the output code of the index page of "Output HTML tree".

 * Added the "Open Source URL" command back to the dropdown menu of
   the ScrapBook toolbar, and it now opens the corresponding source
   URL for a deep-saved page as well.

 * Notification box of "Save multiple URLs" no more shows an empty icon.

 * No more output the HTML tree automatically before entering Option
   dialog.

 * Now fallbacks to use the profile folder if the selected ScrapBook
   directory cannot be used.

 * Now automatically refreshes the UI and outputs HTML tree when the
   "data.path" preference is manually modified.

Also includes some code clean-up and documentation improvements.
