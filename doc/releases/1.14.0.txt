Scrapbook X 1.14.0
==================

This is the first release of 1.14 series and is identical to
v1.14.0rc11 except for version number and documentation.


Compatibility notes (with 1.13.*)
---------------------------------

 * User preference schema was slightly changed.

   The behavior of value 0 of "fulltext.sitePagesLimit" user preference
   is different between 1.13 and 1.14 series.

 * Added support for export time recording.

   The export time of an exported item recorded in index.dat is only
   supported in 1.14 series and will be ignored in older versions.


Changes since v1.13.12
----------------------

General user interface:

 * Detail save options now only be remembered when "Remember current
   options" is checked.

 * Added the "Open Source URL" command back to the dropdown menu of
   the ScrapBook toolbar, and it now opens the corresponding source
   URL for a deep-saved page as well.

 * Recovered the "Site Map" command in the toolbar dropdown menu.

 * Recovered the old-style status bar button in Firefox < 4.0.
   (Available via Status-4-Evar or similar addons.)

 * Notification for a web page that is already saved now shows on the
   top of a tab.

 * No more output the HTML tree automatically before entering Option
   dialog.

 * Now fallbacks to use the profile folder if the selected ScrapBook
   directory cannot be used.

 * Sort wizard now consider a bookmark item as an individual group
   when "Group by Type" is checked.

 * Added "Sort by URL" option to Sort wizard.

User preference:

 * Changed "fulltext.sitePagesLimit": now 0 means 0 ("index no deep
   page") and a negative means infinity ("index unlimited deep pages").

 * Added "fulltext.updateSizeThreshold": if the cache size is smaller
   than this set size (KiB), it is updated whenever a fulltext search
   is performed. (A negative means infinity, i.e. always update cache.)

 * Added "fulltext.updateTimeThreshold": if the cache file is older
   than this set time (minutes), it will be updated when a fulltext
   search is performed. (A negative means infinity, i.e. never update
   an old cache.)

 * Added "data.rdfBackupKeepDays": backup RDFs that are older than this
   set time (days) will be removed during a check. (A negative means
   infinity, i.e. never remove backup RDFs.)

 * Added "data.rdfBackupRemoveLimit": the maximal number of expired backup
   RDFs that will be removed during a check. (A negative means infinity,
   i.e. remove all expired backup RDFs during a check.)

 * When the "data.path" preference is manually modified, ScrapBook X
   now keeps using the old value, and no more automatically refreshes
   the UI and outputs HTML tree.

Save functionality:

 * Provides the referer header when saving a page to avoid access
   restriction of some web sites.

 * Fixed an issue that some web pages cannot be saved due to a
   malformatted CSSStyleSheet object.

Export functionality:

 * The exported time of an item is now recorded as a property in the
   index.dat.  If it's not available, the last modified time of the
   item folder is used as a fallback.

   This solved an issue that the order of exported items are messed up
   after re-imported on Linux or when the user has modified them.

 * The Manage dialog now displays the exported time in ISO format.

Also includes many code clean-up, documentation revises, and localization 
and tooltip improvements.
