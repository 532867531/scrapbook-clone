Scrapbook X 1.13.0b4
====================

We skipped version 1.13.0b3 to fix a pack error after uploading that version to the Firefox AMO.

Changes since v1.13.0b2
-----------------------

Bug fixes:

 * Added missing icons for several user interface commands.

Functionality changes:

 * The capture dialog now automatically starts the capture process without user confirmation and has a simpler user interface for link capture, capture again, and so on.

 * The "move up", "move down", and "delete" commands in the combine wizard now automatically scrolls the list and keeps the manipulated item visible.

 * Added "Alt+Up", "Alt+Down", and "Delete" as accesskeys for the combine wizard commands.

Also improved several zh-CN and zh-TW localization and includes several trivial internal code documentation updates.
