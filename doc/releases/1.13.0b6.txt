Scrapbook X 1.13.0b6
====================

Changes since v1.13.0b5
-----------------------

Bug fixes:

 * Fixed several bad handling cases for URLs with non-ASCII chars on capture.

 * Some linked local files are not included when a page is captured or combined.

 * "Combined View" and "Open All in tabs" do not work for non-folder-type folders.

 * Fulltext search result shows incorrect folder for non-folder-type folders.

   A rebuild of fulltext cache is required. If it does not fix the issue, manually delete of the cache.rdf file in the ScrapBook directory before rebuilding fulltext cache would be required.

 * Fixed a rare risk of incorrectly modifying a page with a specific pattern including a UUID on capture.

Functionality changes:

 * Added a new usage demo to the default filters of the capture dialog.

 * Adjusted the user interface behavior of the data tree:

   * Single click on a folder no more toggles it in the manage window or folder picker dialog.

   * Single click on a non-folder-type folder item now opens it in the sidebar.

   * Note pages now are opened in the new tab according to the option "Edit Note" instead of "Open".

 * Added a general option "Use manage mode in the sidebar".
 
   This makes the sidebar work like the "Manage" window, such as allowing multiple selection and acting on double-click instead of single-click.

 * New capture option available via "capture.default.linkURLFilters" user preference.

   This is a JSON data containing a simple string, a RegExp string (e.g. "/\\.php/i"), or an array with combination of them. It can be used to exclude some offending URLs that should never be visited, for example, a link that logouts the user.

   If the provided string is invalid, it will be ignored and the error will be output to the browser console for trouble shooting.

Also includes some internal code optimization and documentation improving.
