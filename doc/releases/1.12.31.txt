Scrapbook X 1.12.31
===================

Changes since v1.12.30
----------------------

- FIXED: Moving items by dragging does not work in Firefox >= 48.
- FIXED: Several wrong or bad localizations.
- UPDATE: Use old ScrapBook style fulltext caching mechanism for sites (deep-captured items) to prevent several performance issues for those with very much pages. This could prevent some information from being cached, though.
- UPDATE: Adjusted internal coding style.
