Scrapbook X 1.14.0rc8
=====================

Changes since v1.14.0rc7
------------------------

 * Fixed an issue that, when using "Match HTTP header and URL file
   extension", a redirected link is treated as if it had no HTTP
   header.

 * Fixed an issue that, when using "Match HTTP header and URL file
   extension", an HTML page that happens to have an extension that
   matches the download rules is treated as a file instead of a web
   page.

 * Fixed an issue that an item with a title having leading or trailing
   dots or slashes could be exported with a bad folder name.
